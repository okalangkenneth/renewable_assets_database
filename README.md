# Renewable Assets Database
I accomplished this modest fictitious renewable asset management database project using SQL Server and SSMS. The idea is to accumulate and manipulate the records in the different Swedish counties taking into consideration their names, locations, dates created, revenues, reviews, and their respective CEOs.

The user is able to export a report into excel for further analysis or create a project in Asp.Net.Core with the help of C# but with SQL queries applied in extracting the required information.
