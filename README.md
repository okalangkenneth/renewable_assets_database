# Renewable Assets Database
I accomplished this modest renewable asset management database project using SQL Server and SSMS. The idea is to accumulate and manipulate the renewable assets records in the different Swedish counties taking into consideration their names, locations, dates created, revenues, reviews, and their respective CEOs.

The user is able to export a report into excel for further analysis or create a project in Asp.Net.Core with the help of C# but with SQL queries applied in extracting the required information.

One can consider using SSIS for importing data from various sources, SSAS for analyzing data in different ways, and SSRS for creating professional-looking reports. Additionally, adding more data such as energy output, maintenance costs, or carbon footprint can provide a more comprehensive view of renewable assets.

It's also important to validate data entered into the database and add user authentication and authorization if multiple users will access the database. Encapsulating SQL queries in stored procedures can provide better performance, security, and maintainability.
